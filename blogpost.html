    <h1>Plants</h1>
    <p>Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes, forming the kingdom Plantae. Most of them are multicellular. 
        Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi. 
    </p>
    <p>All current definitions exclude the fungi and some of the algae. By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae 
        (Latin name for "green plants") which consists of the green algae and the Embryophyta or land plants. The latter include 
        hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns, conifers and other gymnosperms, and flowering plants. A definition based 
        on genomes includes the Viridiplantae, along with the red algae and the glaucophytes, in the clade Archaeplastida.
    </p>  
    <p>
        Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. 
        Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis using the pigment chlorophyll, which gives them their green colour.
